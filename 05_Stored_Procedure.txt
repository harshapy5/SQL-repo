-- In this section, we learn about the SQL Sored Procedure.
-- What is a Stored Procedure?

  --  The stored procedure is a prepared SQL query that you can save so that the query can be reused over and over again. 
  -- So, if the user has an SQL query that you write over and over again, keep it as a stored procedure and execute it.
  -- Users can also pass parameters to a stored procedure so that the stored procedure can act based on the parameter value that is given.

-- Sntax of a Stored Procedure.
