-- In MYSQL, there are majorly five types of SQL Commands.
-- DDL – Data Definition Language
-- DQL – Data Query Language
-- DML – Data Manipulation Language
-- DCL – Data Control Language
-- TCL – Transaction Control Language

-- DDL - Data Definiton Language
1. CREATE     -- Used to create Databse objects like Tables, Views, Functions, Procedure, Triggers.
2. ALTER      -- Used to alter the Structure of Table.
3. DROP       -- Used to deleter objects from Database.
4. TRUNCATE   -- Used to delete records from a table.

);

-- ALTER -- Always used with 'ADD', 'MODIFY', 'DROP'
ALTER TABLE employee ADD city CHAR(20)
DESCRIBE employee;
ALTER TABLE employes MODIFY name CHAR (30) NOT NULL;

-- DROP 
DROP TABLE <Table_name>;
DROP DATABSE <Database_name>;

-- TRUNCATE
TRUNCATE TABLE <Table_name>;

-- DML commands - Data Manipulation Language 
INSERT        -- It is used to insert data into a table.
UPDATE        -- It is used to update existing data within a table.
DELETE        -- It is used to delete records from a database table.

VALUES(NULL, NULL,'2019-11-19', 'F', 14.0, 23.1, 'No')

-- UPDATE 
UPDATE <Table_name> SET col1 = Val1, Col2 = Val2, etc WHERE <Condition>;

-- DELETE
DELETE FROM <table_name> WHERE <Condition>;

-- DCL - Data Conrol Language
DCL includes commands such as GRANT and REVOKE which mainly deal with the rights, permissions, and other controls of the database system.

-- GRANT 
GRANT SELECT, UPDATE ON MY_TABLE TO SOME_USER, ANOTHER_USER;  

-- REVOKE
REVOKE SELECT, UPDATE ON MY_TABLE FROM USER1,USER2;

-- DQL - Data Query Language
SELECT : It is used to retrieve data from a table

SELECT * FROM <Table_name>;


-- TCL - Transaction Control Language  
COMMIT
ROLLBACK
SAVEPOINT

1. COMMIT : 
This command is used to save the data permanently. 
Whenever we perform any of the DML command like -INSERT, DELETE or UPDATE, these can be rollback if the data is not stored permanently. 
So in order to be at the safer side COMMIT command is used. 

Syntax:  
commit; 

2. ROLLBACK : 
This command is used to get the data or restore the data to the last savepoint or last committed state. 
If due to some reasons the data inserted, deleted or updated is not correct, you can rollback the data to a particular savepoint or if 
savepoint is not done, then to the last committed state. 

Syntax:  
rollback;

3. SAVEPOINT : 
This command is used to save the data at a particular point temporarily, so that whenever needed can be rollback to that particular point. 

Syntax:  
Savepoint A;
